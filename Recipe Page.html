<h1> Gulab Jamun</h1>
<ul><h2>Ingredients</h2></ul>
<ul><h4>For the Gulab Jamun Dough<h4></ul>
  <ol>1 cup milk powder</ol>
  <ol>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)</ol>
  <ol>¬º teaspoon baking soda</ol>
  <ol>Milk (as needed, approximately 2-3 tablespoons)</ol>
<ul><h3>For the Sugar Syrup</h3></ul>
  <ol>1 ¬Ω cups sugar</ol>
  <ol> few strands of saffron (optional)</ol>
  <ol>1 teaspoon rose water or ¬º teaspoon rose essence (optional)</ol><ul/>
<p><h2>Instructions</h2><//p>
Step 1: Prepare the Sugar Syrup
In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Stir and bring it to a boil.
Once it boils, add crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands, and let it simmer on low heat for 8-10 minutes until it thickens slightly.
Add rose water or rose essence, if desired, and set the syrup aside, keeping it warm.
Step 2: Prepare the Gulab Jamun Dough
In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.
Add ghee and mix it with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and gently mix to form a soft dough. Be careful not to knead too much, as the dough should be just combined and smooth.
Cover the dough and let it rest for 5 minutes.
Step 3: Shape and Fry the Gulab Jamun
Divide the dough into small equal portions and gently roll each portion into a smooth, crack-free ball.
In a deep pan, heat oil or ghee over medium-low heat.
Fry the balls in batches, stirring gently to ensure even cooking, until they turn golden brown. This may take about 7-8 minutes for each batch.
Remove and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
Step 4: Soak in Syrup
Warm the sugar syrup if it has cooled, ensuring it‚Äôs hot but not boiling.
Add the fried Gulab Jamun balls into the warm syrup and let them soak for at least 2-3 hours, allowing them to absorb the syrup and become soft and juicy.
Serving
Serve the Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped pistachios or almonds, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Gulab Jamun! üç¨</p>
